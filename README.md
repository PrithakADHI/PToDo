<h1>My First dJango Project</h1>
This was my first time ever attempting to do a dJango Project, and hence why it isn't that good.

<h1>HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT</h1>

1. Make sure that Python is installed in your system,
2. Download the project and activte the virtual environment (I used mac to do this project so idk if this will work on a Windows or Linux machine)
3. cd into Todoproject/
4. "python manage.py runserver"
5. Then, go into your browser and type: "localhost:8000"

<h1>HOW TO USE THE APP</h1>

1. Goto The CreateToDo Page, and write your name and Todos
2. Then, go to the home page, write your name, and then click on View


How did I do for this first project??
